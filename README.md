# Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction--Classification-Analysis


This project aims to explore and visualize handwritten numerical data using Python and scikit-learn.

The dataset consists of 8x8 pixel grayscale images with numbers 0-9, totaling 1797 samples. The main goal is to understand the structure and content of the material through visual observation. The project starts by loading the dataset with the command sklearn.datasets.load_digits, which provides access to properties such as images (arrays of pixel data) and object (proper labels). 

Using matplotlib.pyplot, the script plots the first 4 figures next to their titles. Each image is displayed in grayscale with nearest neighbor interpolation to maintain image clarity. 

This visualization step is crucial for initial data exploration and provides insight into the variability of the dataset and potential challenges in classification tasks. 

This project is the basis for learning data visualization techniques and preparing data for subsequent machine learning applications.
